            The journey from registration to participation involves a few
            critical steps. The first step is to complete the registration form.

            evaluated based on creativity, functionality, and technical
            execution. So, make sure to give your best! After you have prepared
            your solutions, you need to submit them before the given deadline.
            Please note that late submissions may not be accepted, so keep an
            eye on the dates.
