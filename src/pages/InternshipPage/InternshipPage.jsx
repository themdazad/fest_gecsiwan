            Interns will also have the opportunity to work on live projects.
            This hands-on experience with real-world projects will enable them
            to understand the nuances of software development, including
            problem-solving, teamwork, meeting deadlines, and handling project
            deliveries. This, in turn, will prepare them to tackle challenges
            they may face in their future jobs.
